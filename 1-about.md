<h3> Welcome to my website! </h3>

<p>
My name is Carmen Amo Alonso and I work at the intersection of Control Theory and Natural Language Processing with <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-zeilinger/people/person-detail.MTQyNzM3.TGlzdC8xOTI5LDg4NTM5MTE3.html">Prof. Melanie Zeilinger</a>, <a href="https://rycolab.io/#about">Prof. Ryan Cotterell</a>, and <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/">Prof. Florian DÃ¶rfler</a>. To learn more about my research, head over to the <a href="publications/">Publications tab</a>!

Before joining ETH, I obtained a Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems at the <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu">Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech</a>, where I worked under the advice of <a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~doyle/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Prof. John Doyle</a>. My thesis was awarded with the <a href="https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/Clauser#milton-and-francis-clauser-doctoral-prize">Milton and Francis Clauser Doctoral Prize</a>, which recognizes the best Ph.D. dissertation of the academic year across all disciplines at Caltech. During my Ph.D., I was awarded a <a href=" https://www.deshaw.com"> D. E. Shaw Exploration Fellowship </a> and an  <a href=" https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/caltech-names-eight-ai4science-fellows-supported-by-amazon"> Amazon AI4Science Fellowship</a>. I also had the honor to have been invited to both <a href="https://risingstars.utexas.edu">EECS Rising Stars</a> and <a href="https://cps-rising-stars2022.com">CPS Rising Stars</a> workshops, and I am proud to have been named a <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/news-events/news/carmen-amo-alonso-tinashe-handina-and-ivan-jimenez-rodriguez-selected-as-leap-fellows">fellow of the LEAP Alliance</a>, whose goal is to increase diversity across the field of computing. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I received a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Madrid in 2016 and a M.Sc. in Space Engineering from Caltech in 2017.

I am very proud to be a member of the academic community. I am a strong believer that access to education is a fundamental right, and that an educated society is a more equitable and inclusive one. For this reason, I strive to make my research accesible to anyone who is interested in learning about it and I participate in a number of outreach opportunities. I turn many of my papers into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLCJ7kcGJ-yxTg503E3JQaw">Youtube videos</a> for those who prefer watching over reading, and I always make myself available to discuss research:<a href= "mailto:camoalonso@ethz.ch"> feel free to reach out!</a> I also believe that in order for research to be more accessible, it must be easily reproducible. You can find all the code needed to reproduce my papers in my <a href="https://github.com/camoalon">Github repository</a>.
