Autonomous driving systems, whether rule-based or data-driven, face challenges in handling long-tail driving scenarios. Recent works explore the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems, emphasizing their ability to mimic human common sense and reasoning ability in scenarios that are too complex for rule-based approaches and too uncommon for sufficient data collection. However, limitations such as LLM hallucinations, which pose significant safety concerns, remain. In this work, we propose the Safe-NARRATE architecture that combines LLMs with optimization-based control; specifically model predictive controllers equipped with safety filters to enhance decision reliability. Through simulation of a case study, we show that the proposed architecture has a 20% increase in safe task execution compared to existing methods.
