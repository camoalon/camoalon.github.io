We present a solution to deal with information package dropouts in distributed controllers for large-scale networks. We do this by leveraging the System Level Synthesis approach, a control framework particularly suitable for large-scale networks that addresses information exchange in a very transparent manner. To this end, we propose two different schemes for controller synthesis and implementation. The first one synthesizes a controller inherently robust to dropouts, which is later implemented in an offline fashion. For the second approach, we synthesize a collection of controllers offline and then switch between different controllers online depending on the current dropouts detected in the system. The two approaches are illustrated and compared by means of a simulation example.
