<p style="text-align: justify;"> For me, a fundamental aspect of research is sharing knowledge with others. I really enjoy mentoring students, giving lectures, and taking part in outreach opportunities. While doing these, I learn a lot too: everyone has something to teach us! <br> <br>

I believe in using education to uplift individuals who can, in turn, serve their communities. To pursue this goal, I focus on building a learning community grounded in shared purpose and growth beyond individual achievement. I always ground my teaching and mentoring in the principles below:</p>

<ul class="teaching-principles">
<li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><strong>Creating a Collaborative Learning Environment.</strong> I strive to build a sense of community and belonging, where students feel valued and engaged in a shared mission.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><strong>Establishing Clear Learning Goals.</strong> I articulate expectations and learning objectives to guide learning and ensure all students receive the same information and opportunities.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><strong>Grounding Foundations in Applications.</strong> I create an environment where students do not see themselves as knowledge consumers but as future contributors to their fields.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><strong>Assessing Learning Comprehensively.</strong> I evaluate both technical mastery and conceptual understanding while attending to students' individual needs. I put special emphasis in evaluating students' capacity to apply their knowledge to solve problems and communicate it to others.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><strong>Championing Knowledge-Sharing.</strong> In both classroom teaching and individual mentoring, I emphasize knowledge-sharing as a core educational value.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Research mentoring </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I regularly mentor undergraduate and graduate students on a number of research projects. If you are a student <b>at Stanford</b> and would like to work with me, please <a href= "mailto:camoalon@stanford.edu"> get in touch!</a> </p>

<h3> Institutional teaching </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I have served multiple times as a teaching assistant, head teaching assistant, and instructor at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Here is a list of the courses that I have co-taught or assisted in teaching: </p>

- Co-Instructor for Distributed Model Predictive Control (ETH)
- Co-Instructor for Projects in Machine Learning Research (ETH)
- Head of Teaching Assistants for Introductory Methods of Applied Mathematics (ACM 95/100, Caltech) 
- Head of Teaching Assistants for Introduction to Probability Models (ACM 116, Caltech)
- Teaching Assistant for Robust Control Theory (CDS 231, Caltech)
- Teaching Assistant for Optimal Control and Estimation (CDS 112, Caltech)
- Teaching Assistant for Network Control Systems (CDS 141, Caltech)

<h3> Other teaching and outreach </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am a strong believer that education has the power to change lives! For this reason, I am very invested in teaching and outreach activities, specially in underserved communities. If you happen to know about some suitable opportunities, please <a href= "mailto:camoalon@stanford.edu"> let me know!</a> </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> One of my favorite experiences during my Ph.D. was participating in <a href= "https://clubesdeciencia.mx"> Clubes de Ciencia</a>: a non-profit organization that organizes summer intensive courses for senior highschool and freshman college students across different cities in Mexico. In 2023, I got selected to teach in Merida! I designed and co-instructed an interactive  course aimed at familirizing students with the capabilities and intrinsic risks of language technologies. During our time together, students downloaded and tested different large language models and learned how to use Python to analyze some metrics of consistency and accuracy. They also explored the current limitations and challenges of artificial intelligence. The students grasped the importance of education and knowledge-sharing, and by the end of the course, they decided to create an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hablando-con-la-maquina-cdcmx/miembros-del-club?authuser=1"> amazing website</a> (Spanish only) to share their learnings with friends, family, and future students. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am also regularly invited to visit highschools with predominantly underserved students, where I share my personal experience and help motivate the students to pursue a scientific career. </p>

<h3> Science policy and communication </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I believe that knowledge belongs to all of us, and it should be used to serve society as a whole. For this reason, I engage in science policy. I am a member of the <a href="https://futureoflife.org/our-mission/">Future of Life Institute</a>, a global community promoting responsible AI, and I serve as the Engagement and Education Officer for <a href="https://stanfordscipol.org">Stanford Science Policy Group</a>. I believe that, in a democracy, science communication is science policy: as a citizen, <i>you too</i> get to make decisions about the regulations that rule science and society! At the Stanford Science Policy Group, I lead efforts to make scientific topics available to everyone through blog posts and Instagram reels.
