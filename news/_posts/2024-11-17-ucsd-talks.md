I had the pleasure to give 2 talks at the [Institute for Neural Computation at UC San Diego](https://inc.ucsd.edu/index.php): (1) on [control theory meets natural language](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example1), and (2) on [distributed and localized model predictive control](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example2).
